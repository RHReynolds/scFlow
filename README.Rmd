# scflow

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/combiz/scflow.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/combiz/scflow)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of scflow is to provide tools in R to build a complete analysis workflow for single-cell/nuclei RNA sequencing data.

* Quality control of gene-cell matrices
  - Filtering of matrices by counts and features
  - Filtering of mitochondrial genes and mitochondrial counts thresholding
  - Doublet and multiplet identification and removal with [DoubletFinder](https://github.com/chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder)
  - Rich QC metrics annotation with [scater](https://github.com/davismcc/scater)
  
* Dimensionality reduction and celltype identification
  - Louvain clustering, UMAP dimensionality reduction, and cluster marker gene identification with [monocle](https://github.com/cole-trapnell-lab/monocle-release)
  - Celltype annotation with [EWCE](https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE) and [Liger](https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger)
  - Cluster identity mapping against the [Allen Human Brain Atlas](https://www.brain-map.org) and Mouse Nervous System Data from [Zeisel 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.021)
  
* Differential gene expression implementations
  - Zero-inflated regression model with [MAST](https://github.com/RGLab/MAST)
  - Random effects model with [Limma](https://github.com/cran/limma)
  - Negative binomial distribution pseudobulking model with [DESeq2](https://github.com/mikelove/DESeq2)
  - Pseudobulk generalized likelihood ratio tests with [EdgeR](https://github.com/StoreyLab/edge)
  
* Pathway and functional category enrichment analysis
  - Interface to the Enrichr database with [EnrichR](https://github.com/cran/enrichR)
  - Interface to the WebGestalt tool with [WebGestaltR](http://www.webgestalt.org/)
 
* Publication quality plots and analysis reports
  - QC plots and tabular metrics suitable for reports.
  - UMAP plots for cell features and gene expression.
  - Violin plots for gene expression.
  - Pathway and gene enrichment plots
 
The package functions are designed to interface neatly with [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/) for scalable and containerized pipelines deployed locally, on high-performance computing clusters, or in the cloud.  An accompanying NextFlow pipeline is in the works - TBA.


## Installation

You can install the development version of scflow from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("combiz/scflow")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(scflow)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
