## New features

* `annotate_merged_sce()` and `report_merged_sce()` to examine QC metrics across samples to facilitate identification of problematic samples.
* `find_cells()` annotates cells / empty drops using the EmptyDrops algorithm.  The single-sample QC report generated by `report_qc_sce()` now includes EmptyDrops results with metrics and plots of  algorithm performance.

* `integrate_sce()` runs LIGER on a SingleCellExperiment created by `merge_sce()`, storing the H.norm factors in a `reducedDim()` slot available as an input for dimensionality reduction.
* `reduce_dims_sce()` now includes a parameter for `input_reduced_dim` which accepts one or more of PCA and Liger as input, producing `tSNE_PCA`, `tSNE_Liger`, `UMAP_PCA`, `UMAP_Liger` etc. allowing dimensionality reductions with and without integration to be examined.
* Improved annotation of SingleCellExperiment celltypes by `map_celltypes_sce()` to enable three new functions to write (`write_celltype_mappings()`), read (`read_celltype_mappings()`), and update (`map_custom_celltypes()`) the celltype mappings for a SingleCellExperiment.  This enables cluster -> celltype mappings to be quickly and easily revised if needed.
* `find_impacted_pathways()` and `report_impacted_pathways()` allow a differential gene expression table to be submitted to WebGestalt and ROntoTools (and in future additional tools) and an interactive report to be generated.
