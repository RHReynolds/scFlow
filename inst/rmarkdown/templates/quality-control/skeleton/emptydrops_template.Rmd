A total of `r sum(metadata$qc_summary$qc_cells_n_cells_passed, metadata$qc_summary$qc_cells_n_cells_failed)` putative cells were submitted to the ambient RNA / empty droplet identification method *emptyDrops*.  This identified `r metadata$emptydrops_params$emptydrops_emptydrops_found` empty droplets with an FDR cutoff of ≤ `r metadata$emptydrops_params$emptydrops_alpha_cutoff`.

```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=8, fig.height=4, fig.cap = sprintf("<b>Figure: Distribution of p-values for low total-count barcodes. </b>Ideally this distribution should be close to uniform.  Large peaks near zero would suggest that barcodes with fewer _total_counts_ than the *lower* parameter (lower = %s) are not all ambient.  In this case, further decreasing the *lower* parameter is recommended to ensure that barcodes representing genuine cells with relatively low expression are not used to estimate the ambient profile.", metadata$emptydrops_params$emptydrops_lower)}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
ggplotly(metadata$emptydrops_plots$emptydrops_hist)
```

In addition to this visualization, the uniformity was tested using the `r metadata$emptydrops_params$emptydrops_uniformity_method` which yielded a _p-value_ of `r metadata$emptydrops_params$emptydrops_uniformity_pval` (≤0.05 would suggest non-uniformity).
