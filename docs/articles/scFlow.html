<div id="running-scflow" class="section level1">
<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#running-scflow" class="anchor"></a>Running <em>scFlow</em>
</h1>
<p>The <code>scFlow</code> pipeline requires three main input: a folder containing <code>matrix.mtx.gz</code>, <code>features.tsv.gz</code>, <code>barcodes.tsv.gz</code> for individual samples, a SampleSheet.tsv file which is a tab-separated-variable file with sample metadata and a Manifest.txt file is a tab-separated-variable file with two columns: <code>key</code> and <code>filepath</code>. Details of how to generate the files is given in this <a href="https://github.com/combiz/scFlow/wiki/Generating-a-Manifest-File-and-SampleSheet-for-scFlow">page</a></p>
<p>The basic <code>scFlow</code> workflow for sample QC begins with the import of the feature-barcode sparse matrix with <code>read_sparse_matrix</code>. The metadata for the sample is then imported from a sample sheet with <code>read_metadata</code>. A SingleCellExperiment object is created from the matrix and the metadata using <code>generate_sce</code> which is then annotated with both gene and cell-level data using <code>annotate_sce</code>. We then filter the SingleCellExperiment to select only cells and genes meeting our QC criteria using <code>filter_sce</code>. We can then optionally find singlets in our filtered SingleCellExperiment using <code>find_singlets</code> before filtering them out again with <code>filter_sce</code>. A complete QC report can then be generated using <code>report_qc_sce</code> before saving the filtered and quality-controlled SingleCellExperiment with <code>write_sce</code>.</p>

<p>To run scFlow, we first need to read in the data matrix:</p>

<p>Next, we retrieve the metadata by pointing to a Sample Sheet and specifying a unique identifier (unique_key) in a specific column (key_colname):</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb7"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">

<pre><code>## sex: `M` (factor)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## age: `18` (integer)</code></pre>
<p>For downstream analyses it’s important that the variable classes are correctly specified. Carefully inspect the metadata classes in brackets. In the above example we see that the <em>individual</em> were imported as integer rather than factor variables. Let’s correct this by reloading the metadata, this time specifying the correct variable classes for this variable:-</p>

<pre><code>## Reading /tmp/RtmpHP1bim/tmp_Zeisel2015_scflow/SampleSheet.tsv  </code></pre>
<p>With the metadata imported with the correct variable classes, and the previously loaded sparse matrix, we can generate our <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object:-</p>

<p>The SingleCellExperiment object was succesfully created and we can now proceed with annotation.</p>

<p>In <code>scFlow</code> we specify all of our QC preferences and cutoffs with the <code>annotate_sce</code> command. This will also produce plots in the <code>sce@metadata</code> slot allowing rapid revision and optimization of QC parameters. Lets start with the default parameters by simply providing the <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object to the <code>annotate_sce</code> function:-</p>

<p>Once we merge all the samples into one <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object we can move to the next steps of integration, dimension reduction and clustering. We have implemented <a href="https://github.com/MacoskoLab/liger"><em>liger</em></a> for integrating datasets from multiple samples, treatment and experiments. For optimal integration user should try to use different k values.</p>
<p>Once data integration is done, dimension reduction is performed using multiple methods by default i.e. “PCA”, “tSNE”, “UMAP”, “UMAP3D”. For tSNE and UMAP, dimension reduction is performed using either PCA or Liger values. Once the dimension reduction step is done the <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object is ready for clustering.</p>

<p>The next step is to annotate the celltypes for each cluster. Here, we will use the package <a href="https://github.com/NathanSkene/EWCE"><em>ewce</em></a>. For this we use the following command (This may take a while):-</p>

<p>The celltypes for each cell can be found in <code>sce@colData$cluster_celltype</code> slot. We can also generate UMAP_Liger plot for each celltype.</p>

<p>We need to subset the merged <code>SingleCellExperiment</code> object to perform differential expression analysis. Here we are using <code>MASTZLM</code> for differential expression analysis. For example, we are interested in performing DE analysis in the <code>Oligo</code> cell cluster. So, we first subset the <code>Oligo</code> cluster.</p>

<p>We need to specify the colData column name as dependent_var as the variable of interest for DE analysis. For example here we want to perform DE analysis between Case and Controls which is found in <code>diagnosis</code> column. ref_class is the reference group for DE analysis. If there are any confounding variables those colData names can be passed through confounding_vars argument.</p>
